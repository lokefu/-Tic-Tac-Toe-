Game description with basic game rules.
The game is for two players, the user vs the computer, who take turns choosing the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
The game will display the original 3x3 grid for the user.
The user always plays first, and the computer randomly choose one place to mark after user's each move.
After one move made by either the user or the computer, the new grid with new mark will be displayed.
The user's mark is presented by 'o' and the computer's mark is presented by 'x'.
The player who first manage to place three of marks in a vertical, horizantal or diagonal row will be the winner.
After the winner come up, the game closes and the programme will ask the user whether the user wants to start a new round or not.
